# NightClubSimulation
Welcome to the Nightclub Simulation project, a Java Swing application showcasing dynamic interactions within a nightclub environment. This simulation incorporates key programming concepts and features to create a realistic and engaging experience.

# Features
Male-Female Interactions: Explore the dynamics of males approaching females with outcomes ranging from successful interactions to bouncer interventions.

Bouncer Regulation: Bouncers play a crucial role in maintaining order, preventing unwanted advances, and enforcing consequences for rejected males.

Consequences for Rejected Males: Rejected males may turn to drinking alcohol, affecting their chances to approach females.

Alternative Strategy for Males: Discover an alternative narrative as rejected males attempt to leave the nightclub with two girls.

Female Responses: Females exhibit avoidance behavior and may leave with males who successfully approach them.

Population Dynamics: Experience changes in the overall population as females leave with males, and bouncers regulate the flow by kicking out unwanted males.

Population Growth and Bouncer Reaction: Witness the adaptation of the environment as bouncer numbers increase in response to a growing male population.
